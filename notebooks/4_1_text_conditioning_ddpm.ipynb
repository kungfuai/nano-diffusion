    "\n",
    "Conditioning means prompting. So far, we have been doing unconditional image generation from pure noise, or generation without prompting as any context information:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textrm{noise} \\rightarrow \\textrm{image}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it is cool to see the model generate interesting images like animal faces, it is not very useful yet as it lacks user control.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will start to add text conditioning to the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textrm{text} + \\textrm{noise} \\rightarrow \\textrm{image}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so that a prompt like \"a black cat with lots of fur\" can actually trigger the model to follow the instruction and generate such an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular approach to do text-to-Image generation is \"classifier-free guidance\". Historically, the first major technique along these lines was \"classifier guidance\", which relies on a separate classifier to steer image synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ be the image, and $y$ be the text prompt. There are 2 distributions we could sample from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- unconditional distribution $p_{\\theta}(x)$: \"what do images look like in general?\"\n",
    "- conditional distribution $p_{\\theta}(x \\mid y)$: \"what do images look like given a text prompt $y$?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the Bayes rule, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{\\theta}(x \\mid y) \\propto p_{\\theta}(x) \\cdot p_{\\theta}(y \\mid x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the gradient of the log-probability,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla_{x} \\log p_{\\theta}(x \\mid y) = \\nabla_{x} \\log p_{\\theta}(x) + \\nabla_{x} \\log p_{\\theta}(y \\mid x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\nabla_{x_t} \\log p_{\\theta}(x_t)$ is approximately the output of the denoising model (the noise prediction), up to a constant factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can think of text-conditioned generation as taking the unconditional model \n",
    "and adjusting (\"tweaking\") it with $p_{\\theta}(y \\mid x)$, which is a \"classifier\" that predicts the label or text description given an image. When we add these two terms, we steer the generation toward images that are both likely under the unconditional model and consistent with the text $y$. This is the core idea behind classifier guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classifier Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "With classifier guidance, there are 2 models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a diffusion model trained to denoise images (learn $p_{\\theta}(x)$)\n",
    "- a separate classifier trained to predict the label or text (e.g. cat, dog, etc.) $y$ given an image $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "During generation (the reverse diffusion process), at each step we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the partially denoised image $x_t$.\n",
    "2. Run it through the classifier to get a prediction $\\log p_{\\theta}(y \\mid x_t)$.\n",
    "3. Compute gradient of the log-probability $\\nabla_{\\theta} \\log p_{\\theta}(y \\mid x_t)$ that tells us how to tweak $x_t$ to be more consistent with the label $y$.\n",
    "4. Mix this gradient into the diffusion model’s own prediction to push the sample toward matching $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $y$ is \"a cat sitting on a mat,\" the classifier $p_{\\theta}(y \\mid x_t)$ evaluates the likelihood of $x_t$ matching this description. The guidance term $\\nabla_{x} \\log p_{\\theta}(y \\mid x_t)$ nudges the model to refine samples towards features of a cat on a mat, while $\\nabla_{x} \\log p_{\\theta}(x)$ ensures the output remains realistic and coherent as an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it works, it requires training or fine-tuning a separate classifier that can handle noisy intermediate images. Usually the classifier is tied to specific labels or tasks, which limits its flexibility.\n",
