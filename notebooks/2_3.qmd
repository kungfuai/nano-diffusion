As each training run goes from hours to days or weeks, the choice of GPU becomes more important.
We want to get a high quality model. We want to have fast iteration speed: time is valuable. We want to keep all the training experiments
under a budget.

Here is a comparison training on two popular GPUs on Lambda Labs: A10 and H100.

## H100
