title: "Scaling up"
---

In the next set of tutorials, we'll be scaling up our training recipes for diffusion and flow matching. There are several dimensions of scaling:

1. Data dimension: for images this means increasing the resolution.
2. Model size: the number of parameters in the denoising model.
3. Dataset size: the number of examples in the training set.
4. Compute: the amount of compute (e.g. H100 hours) and the number of GPUs for parallel training.
